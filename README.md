# Data-Structures

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I have compiled a comprehensive collection of data structures implemented in Python. This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of data structures, as well as for those seeking Python implementations for academic, personal, or professional projects.

Data Structures Included
This repository contains the following data structures:

Array Data Structure

Implementation and operations on arrays, the most basic and fundamental data structure.
Linked List Data Structure

A detailed implementation of both singly and doubly linked lists, along with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Matrix Data Structure

Representation and manipulation of matrices, including operations like matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Stack Data Structure

Implementation of the stack data structure with operations like push, pop, and peek.
Queue Data Structure

Implementation of the queue data structure with operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and front.
Binary Tree Data Structure

Basic binary tree operations including insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and searching.
Binary Search Tree Data Structure

An implementation of binary search trees (BST), featuring operations like search, insert, delete, and traversal.
Heap Data Structure

Representation of heaps (both max and min), along with heap operations like insert, delete, and heapify.
Hashing Data Structure

Implementation of hashing techniques with examples of hash functions, collision resolution methods, and applications.
Graph Data Structure

Graph representations (both adjacency matrix and adjacency list) and fundamental graph algorithms.
Usage
The code in this repository is written in Python and can be used as a reference or a starting point for implementing these data structures in your projects. Each data structure is implemented in a separate file for clarity and ease of understanding.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome, especially in the areas of optimization, adding new data structures, and implementing additional functions for existing structures. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
